For more information, such as How Vbootkit works, download the presentation from nvlabs.in

NOTE: Vbootkit 2.0 currently works on Windows 7 Beta, build 7000 x64 edition to be exact and might/might-not work with other versions or builds.Minor changes might be required to support the other builds/versions.


Compiling Vbootkit 2.0
======================

switch to build directory and run build.bat
This will give you an ISO image containing Vbootkit 2, which can be used to test out functionality

*A pre-build ISO already exists, so as users can directly test it out


To compile pingv client, you can use Visual Studio ( express edition works fine) and build the exe yourself.Just in case, prebuilt EXE's are also there in the directory.

Testing Vbootkit 2.0
======================

Just boot the Windows 7 system, using the Vbootkit 2 CD and uncross your fingers ( so as you can type commands !!!)

Now, execute pingv.exe IP address command-code

The command codes are  
		Command Code      Action 

		0                 Get Signature immediate 

		1                 Get Signature Delayed

		2                 Get Keylog data 

		3                 Escalate CMD.EXE privileges

		4                 Reset Passwords/Set Passwords( toggles between states) ( This effect can be persistant )

		


Vbootkit does not try to stick to your system in any case.
